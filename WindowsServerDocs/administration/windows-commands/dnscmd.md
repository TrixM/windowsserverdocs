# Dnscmd

> Applies To: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

A command-line interface for managing DNS servers. This utility is useful in scripting batch files to help automate routine DNS management tasks, or to perform simple unattended setup and configuration of new DNS servers on your network.  

## Syntax  

```
dnscmd <ServerName> <command> [<command parameters>]  
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter   |                         Description                          |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| &lt;ServerName&gt; | The IP address or host name of a remote or local DNS server. |

## Commands

### <a name="BKMK_1"></a>dnscmd /ageallrecords  

Sets the current time on a time stamp on resource records at a specified zone or node on a DNS server.  

#### Syntax  

```
dnscmd [<ServerName>] /ageallrecords <ZoneName>[<NodeName>] | [/tree]|[/f]  
```

#### Parameters

**&lt;ServerName>

Specifies the DNS server that the administrator plans to manage, represented by IP address, fully qualified domain name (FQDN), or Host name. If this parameter is omitted, the local server is used.

**&lt;ZoneName>

Specifies the FQDN of the zone.

**&lt;NodeName>

Specifies a specific node or subtree in the zone. *NodeName* specifies the node or subtree in the zone using the following:

-   @ for root zone or FQDN

-   The FQDN of a node (the name with a period (.) at the end)

-   A single label for the name relative to the zone root

/tree

Specifies that all child nodes also receive the time stamp.

/f

Runs the command without asking for confirmation.

#### Remarks

-   The **ageallrecords** command is for backward compatibility between the current version of DNS and previous releases of DNS in which aging and scavenging were not supported. It adds a time stamp with the current time to resource records that do not have a time stamp, and it sets the current time on resource records that do have a time stamp.

-   Record scavenging does not occur unless the records are time stamped. Name server (NS) resource records, start of authority (SOA) resource records, and Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) resource records are not included in the scavenging process, and they are not time stamped even when the **ageallrecords** command runs.

-   This command fails unless scavenging is enabled for the DNS server and the zone. For information about how to enable scavenging for the zone, see the **aging** parameter under Zone-Level Syntax in the <a href="#BKMK_3" data-raw-source="[config](#BKMK_3)">config</a> command.

-   The addition of a time stamp to DNS resource records makes them incompatible with DNS servers that run on operating systems other than Windows 2000, Windows XP, or Windows Server 2003. A time stamp that you add by using the **ageallrecords** command cannot be reversed.

-   if none of the optional parameters are specified, the command returns all resource records at the specified node. If a value is specified for at least one of the optional parameters, **dnscmd** enumerates only the resource records that correspond to the value or values that are specified in the optional parameter or parameters.
  
#### Example

See <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc784399(v=ws.10).aspx" data-raw-source="[Example 1: Set the current time on a time stamp to resource records](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc784399(v=ws.10).aspx)">Example 1: Set the current time on a time stamp to resource records</a>.

### <a name="BKMK_2"></a>dnscmd /clearcache

Clears the DNS cache memory of resource records on the specified DNS server.

#### Syntax

<code>dnscmd [&lt;ServerName&gt;] /clearcache</code>

#### Parameters

`<ServerName>`

Specifies the DNS server to manage, represented by IP address, FQDN, or host name. If this parameter is omitted, the local server is used.
  
#### Sample usage

<code>dnscmd dnssvr1.contoso.com /clearcache</code>

### <a name="BKMK_3"></a>dnscmd /config

changes values in the registry for the DNS server and individual zones. Accepts server-level settings and zone-level settings.

> [!CAUTION]

> Do not edit the registry directly unless you have no alternative. The registry editor bypasses standard safeguards, allowing settings that can degrade performance, damage your system, or even require you to reinstall Windows. You can safely alter most registry settings by using the programs in Control Panel or Microsoft Management Console (mmc). If you must edit the registry directly, back it up first. Read the registry editor help for more information.

#### Server-level syntax

<code>dnscmd [&lt;ServerName&gt;] /config &lt;Parameter&gt;</code>

#### dnscmd /config

Modifies the configuration of the specified server.

#### Parameters

`<ServerName>`

Specifies the DNS server that you are planning to manage, represented by local computer syntax, IP address, FQDN, or host name. If this parameter is omitted, the local server is used.

`<Parameter>`

Specify a setting and, as an option, a value. Parameter values use this syntax: *Parameter* [*Value*]

changes the format of the zone transfer so that it can achieve maximum compression and efficiency. However, this format is not compatible with earlier versions of Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND).

     **0**
     
     Uses maximum compression. This format is compatible with BIND versions 4.9.4 and later only.
     
     **1**

     Sends only one resource record per message to non-Microsoft DNS servers. This format is compatible with BIND versions earlier than 4.9.4. This is the default setting.

**/bootmethod[0|1|2|3]**

Determines the source from which the DNS server gets its configuration information.

**0**

Clears the source of configuration information.

**1**

Loads from the BIND file that is located in the DNS directory, which is %systemroot%\System32\DNS by default.

**2**

Loads from the registry.

**3**

Loads from AD DS and the registry. This is the default setting.

**/defaultagingstate[0|1]**

Determines whether the DNS scavenging feature is enabled by default on newly created zones.

**0**

Disables scavenging. This is the default setting.

**1**

Enables scavenging.

**/defaultnorefreshinterval[0x1-0xFFFFFFFF|0xA8]**

Sets a period of time in which no refreshes are accepted for dynamically updated records. Zones on the server inherit this value automatically. To change the default value, type a value in the range of **0x1-0xFFFFFFFF**. The default value from the server is **0xA8**.

**/defaultrefreshinterval [0x1-0xFFFFFFFF|0xA8]**

Sets a period of time that is allowed for dynamic updates to DNS records. Zones on the server inherit this value automatically. To change the default value, type a value in the range of **0x1-0xFFFFFFFF**. The default value from the server is **0xA8**.

**/disableautoreversezones [0|1]**

Enables or disables the automatic creation of reverse lookup zones. Reverse lookup zones provide resolution of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to DNS domain names.

**0**

Enables the automatic creation of reverse lookup zones. This is the default setting.

**1**

Disables the automatic creation of reverse lookup zones.

**/disablensrecordsautocreation {0|1}**

**/dspollinginterval 0-30**

Specifies how often the DNS server polls AD DS for changes in active directory integrated zones.

**/dstombstoneinterval [1-30]**

The amount of time in seconds to retain deleted records in AD DS.

**/ednscachetimeout [<seconds>]**

Specifies the number of seconds that extended DNS (EDNS) information is cached. The minimum value is 3600, and the maximum value is 15,724,800. The default value is 604,800 seconds (one week).

**/enableednsprobes {0|1}**

**1**

Enables DNSSEC.

**/enableglobalnamessupport {0|1}**

Enables or disables support for the GlobalNames zone. The GlobalNames zone supports resolution of single-label DNS names across a forest.

**0**

Disables support for the GlobalNames zone. When you set the value of this command to **0**, the DNS Server service does not resolve single-label names in the GlobalNames zone.

**1**

Enables support for the GlobalNames zone. When you set the value of this command to **1**, the DNS Server service resolves single-label names in the GlobalNames zone.

**/enableglobalqueryblocklist {0|1}**

Enables or disables support for the global query block list that blocks name resolution for names in the list. The DNS Server service creates and enables the global query block list by default when the service starts the first time. To view the current global query block list, use the **dnscmd /info /globalqueryblocklist** command.

**0**

Logs no events.

**1**

Logs only errors.

**2**

Logs only errors and warnings.

**4**

Logs errors, warnings, and informational events. This is the default setting.

**/forwarddelegations [0|1]**

Determines how the DNS server handles a query for a delegated subzone. These queries can be sent either to the subzone that is referred to in the query or to the list of forwarders that is named for the DNS server. Entries in the setting are used only when forwarding is enabled.

**0**

Automatically sends queries that refer to delegated subzones to the appropriate subzone. This is the default setting.

**1**

forwards queries that refer to the delegated subzone to the existing forwarders.

**/forwardingtimeout [<seconds>]**

Determines how many seconds (0x1-0xFFFFFFFF) a DNS server waits for a forwarder to respond before trying another forwarder. The default value is **0x5**, which is 5 seconds.

**/globalneamesqueryorder** {**0|1**}

Specifies whether the DNS Server service looks first in the GlobalNames zone or local zones when it resolves names.

**0**

The DNS Server service attempts to resolve names by querying the GlobalNames zone before it queries the zones for which it is authoritative.

**1**

The DNS Server service attempts to resolve names by querying the zones for which it is authoritative before it queries the GlobalNames zone.

**/globalqueryblocklist[[<name> [<name>]...]**

replaces the current global query block list with a list of the names that you specify. If you do not specify any names, this command clears the block list. By default, the global query block list contains the following items:

-   isatap

-   wpad

The DNS Server service can remove either or both of these names when it starts the first time, if it finds these names in an existing zone.

**/isslave [0|1]**

Determines how the DNS server responds when queries that it forwards receive no response.

**0**

Specifies that the DNS server is not a subordinate (also known as a *slave*). If the forwarder does not respond, the DNS server attempts to resolve the query itself. This is the default setting.

**1**

Specifies that the DNS server is a subordinate. If the forwarder does not respond, the DNS server terminates the search and sends a failure message to the resolver.

**/localnetpriority [0|1]**

Determines the order in which host records are returned when the DNS server has multiple host records for the same name.

**0**

Returns the records in the order in which they are listed in the DNS database.

**1**

Returns the records that have similar IP network addresses first. This is the default setting.

**/logfilemaxsize [<size>]**

Specifies the maximum size in bytes (0x10000-0xFFFFFFFF) of the Dns.log file. When the file reaches its maximum size, DNS overwrites the oldest events. The default size is 0x400000, which is 4 megabytes (MB).

**/logfilepath [&lt;path+LogFileName&gt;]**

Specifies the path of the Dns.log file. The default path is %systemroot%\System32\Dns\Dns.log. You can specify a different path by using the format *path+LogFileName*.

**/logipfilterlist <IPaddress> [,<IPaddress>...]**

**/serverlevelplugindll[<Dllpath>]**

Specifies the path of a custom plug-in. When *Dllpath* specifies the fully qualified path name of a valid DNS server plug-in, the DNS server calls functions in the plug-in to resolve name queries that are outside the scope of all locally hosted zones. If a queried name is out of the scope of the plug-in, the DNS server performs name resolution using forwarding or recursion, as configured. If *Dllpath* is not specified, the DNS server ceases to use a custom plug-in if a custom plug-in was previously configured.

**/strictfileparsing [0|1]**

Specifies the name of the host.

**&lt;RRtype&gt;**

Specifies the type of resource record to be deleted.

**&lt;Rrdata&gt;**

Specifies the type of data that is expected.

**/f**

executes the command without asking for confirmation:

-   Because nodes can have more than one resource record, this command requires you to be very specific about the type of resource record that you want to delete.

-   if you specify a data type and you do not specify a type of resource record data, all records with that specific data type for the specified node are deleted.

#### Sample usage

<code>dnscmd /recorddelete test.contoso.com test MX 10 mailserver.test.contoso.com</code>

### <a name="BKMK_16"></a>dnscmd /resetforwarders

selects or resets the IP addresses to which the DNS server forwards DNS queries when it cannot resolve them locally.

#### Syntax

<code>dnscmd [&lt;ServerName&gt;] /resetforwarders [&lt;IPaddress&gt; [,&lt;IPaddress&gt;]...][/timeout &lt;timeOut&gt;] [/slave|/noslave]</code>

#### Parameters

**&lt;ServerName&gt;**

Specifies the DNS server to manage, represented by IP address, FQDN, or host name. If this parameter is omitted, the local server is used.

**&lt;IPaddress&gt;**

lists the IP addresses to which the DNS server forwards unresolved queries.

**/timeout <timeOut&gt;**

Sets the number of seconds that the DNS server waits for a response from the forwarder. By default, this value is five seconds.

**/slave|/noslave**

Determines whether the DNS server performs its own iterative queries if the forwarder fails to resolve a query:

**/slave**

Prevents the DNS server from performing its own iterative queries if the forwarder fails to resolve a query.

**/noslave**

Allows the DNS server to perform its own iterative queries if the forwarder fails to resolve a query. This is the default setting.

#### Remarks

-   By default, a DNS server performs iterative queries when it cannot resolve a query.

-   Setting IP addresses by using the **resetforwarders** command causes the DNS server to perform recursive queries to the DNS servers at the specified IP addresses. If the forwarders do not resolve the query, the DNS server can then perform its own iterative queries.

-   if the **/slave** parameter is used, the DNS server does not perform its own iterative queries. This means that the DNS server forwards unresolved queries only to the DNS servers in the list, and it does not attempt iterative queries if the forwarders do not resolve them. It is more efficient to set one IP address as a forwarder for a DNS server. You can use the **resetforwarders** command for internal servers in a network to forward their unresolved queries to one DNS server that has an external connection.

-   listing a forwarder s IP address twice causes the DNS server to attempt to forward to that server twice.

#### Sample usage

<pre>dnscmd dnssvr1.contoso.com /resetforwarders 10.0.0.1 /timeout 7 /slave  
dnscmd dnssvr1.contoso.com /resetforwarders /noslave</pre>

### <a name="BKMK_17"></a>dnscmd /resetlistenaddresses

#### Syntax

<code>dnscmd [&lt;ServerName&gt;] /resetlistenaddresses [&lt;listenaddress&gt;]</code>

#### Parameters

**&lt;ServerName&gt;**

Specifies the DNS server to manage, represented by IP address, FQDN, or host name. If this parameter is omitted, the local server is used.

**&lt;listenaddress&gt;**

Specifies an IP address on the DNS server that listens for DNS client requests. If no listen address is specified, all IP addresses on the server listen for client requests.

#### Remarks

-   By default, all IP addresses on a DNS server listen for client DNS requests.

#### Sample usage

<code>dnscmd dnssvr1.contoso.com /resetlistenaddresses 10.0.0.1</code>

### <a name="BKMK_18"></a>dnscmd /startscavenging

Tells a DNS server to attempt an immediate search for stale resource records in a specified DNS server.

#### Syntax

<code>dnscmd [&lt;ServerName&gt;] /startscavenging</code>

#### Parameter

**&lt;ServerName&gt;**

Specifies the DNS server to manage, represented by IP address, FQDN, or host name. If this parameter is omitted, the local server is used.

#### Remarks

-   Successful completion of this command starts a scavenge immediately.

-   Although the command to start the scavenge appears to complete successfully, the scavenge does not start unless the following preconditions are met:

    -   Scavenging is enabled for both the server and the zone.

    -   The zone is started.
